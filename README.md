## What is Rukkit?
Rukkit is a third-party Rusted Warfare server. You can use it to host Rusted Warfare servers with an experience similar to the official servers, but with better performance and more features. It supports custom mods/maps and server plugins, and includes a game event system that allows you to expand your gameplay experience or create new gameplay mechanics during matches. Rukkit is built on the high-performance Netty framework, theoretically offering better performance than the official servers or clients.  

## What is RukkitX?
RukkitX is a relatively independent third-party fork that is slightly ahead of the main project's development progress, providing more cutting-edge features and bug fixes (**but it does not represent the ideas or decisions of RukkitDev—some features implemented in RukkitX may not be present in Rukkit**).  

## Current Progress  
- [x] Basic gameplay (playable)  
- [x] Custom maps  
- [x] Game synchronization/player rejoin (only supports official maps)  
- [x] Server plugin system  
- [x] Metadata-based mod system (requires tool conversion for rwmod)  
- [x] Support for more than 10 players (1.14+)  
- [X] Relay mode (Experimental)  
- [ ] Non-stop mode (supports join anytime, vote to change maps)  
- [ ] Game event system (partially supported)  
- [ ] Anti-cheat checks (requires game simulation layer, currently unfeasible)  
- [ ] Game command reconstruction (difficult and prone to crashing the game)  

## About  
The plugin system design is inspired by [Nukkit](https://github.com/Nukkit/Nukkit).
